# Using AI Chat Context Files

This guide explains how to effectively use the context files generated by the Chat Context Manager extension to continue conversations with AI assistants.

## What's in a Context File?

When you download a context file from the extension, it contains:

1. **Metadata**: Information about when the conversation took place and which AI platform was used
2. **Summary**: A brief overview of the conversation
3. **Key Insights**: Important points extracted from the conversation
4. **Messages**: The actual back-and-forth between you and the AI

## Using Context Files with Different AI Platforms

### ChatGPT (Web Interface)

1. Open [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com)
2. Start a new conversation
3. Open your context file in a text editor
4. Copy the formatted content from the context file (or use the formatter in the extension)
5. Paste it as your first message to ChatGPT
6. Continue your conversation from where you left off

### Claude (Web Interface)

1. Open [claude.ai](https://claude.ai)
2. Start a new conversation
3. Open your context file in a text editor
4. Copy the formatted content from the context file
5. Paste it as your first message to Claude
6. Continue your conversation from where you left off

### API Usage (For Developers)

If you're using the OpenAI or Anthropic APIs directly, you can use the JSON format output from our context formatter:

```javascript
// Example using OpenAI API
const { Configuration, OpenAIApi } = require("openai");
const configuration = new Configuration({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});
const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);

// Load your context file
const contextFile = require('./path/to/your/context-file.json');

// Format it for API usage
const formattedContext = formatContextForAI(contextFile, {
  format: 'json',
  maxTokens: 4000
});

// Parse the JSON string back to an object
const contextData = JSON.parse(formattedContext);

// Create message array for the API
const messages = [
  {
    role: "system",
    content: "You are continuing a conversation based on the provided context."
  }
];

// Add previous messages
contextData.messages.forEach(msg => {
  messages.push({
    role: msg.role,
    content: msg.content
  });
});

// Add your new message
messages.push({
  role: "user",
  content: "Your new message here"
});

// Make the API call
const response = await openai.createChatCompletion({
  model: "gpt-4",
  messages: messages
});
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: When continuing a conversation, refer to specific points from the previous chat to help the AI understand the context better.

2. **Use Recent Context**: If your conversation was very long, focus on the most recent parts or specific topics you want to continue discussing.

3. **Verify Understanding**: Ask the AI to summarize the previous conversation to ensure it has correctly understood the context.

4. **Keep Context Files Organized**: Name your context files clearly to help you remember what each conversation was about.

## Troubleshooting

### The AI doesn't seem to remember the context

- Check if you're exceeding the AI's context window limit (varies by model)
- Try using the context formatter to create a more concise version
- Focus on only the most relevant parts of the previous conversation

### The AI is confused about the context

- Make sure you've formatted the context properly
- Try explicitly telling the AI that you're continuing a previous conversation
- If using the API, verify that the messages are in the correct order

### The context file is too large

- Use the context formatter options to reduce the size:
  - Exclude the summary or key insights
  - Focus only on recent messages
  - Prioritize the most important exchanges
